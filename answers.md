Buggy1:
    IsEmpty()
    Is empty code is wrong because it runs false when it is a empty deck
Buggy2:
    Size()
    The size is probably starting off at a number thats too low so a one sized deck is 0 or it doesn't register that it has 1 in the deck
Buggy3:
    Match()
    The match is probably a or statement or is set up wrong and its always returning true
Buggy4:
    Deal()
    deal function is probably still trying to deal cards even when empty thus returning with null
